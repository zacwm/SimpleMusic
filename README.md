_I didn't have a better name..._<br />
A simple & _slightly configurable_ Discord.JS v13 music bot!<br />

## FAQ
- **Is there a publicly hosted bot running this?** No. I'm not going to take any Cease and Desists or other legal action from Google when hosting this.
- **Can I have it run as a public bot?** Config allows it, I don't reccomend it. I'm not taking any responsobility if you get any legal action coming your way.
- **"Joins voice chat but just crashes or no audio"** You may need to install [FFMPEG](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+install+FFMPEG)
